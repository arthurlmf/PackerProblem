# Package Challenge Project 

On this project, I solved the Package Challenge.

I have used a greedy strategy which tries to put the most valuable things first until reach the pack weight limit.
I used greedy because the problem can be solved by choosing locally optimal get to global solution.

Also, I have used some design patterns like Singleton, Factory Method, Strategy and Facade.
  
## Getting Started

Run the com.arthurlmf.packerPacker calling the pack(String filePath) method. The only argument is an absolute path passed by String. 

## Running the tests

I have implemented tests using Junit which is located on src/main/test folder.
The input test file is located in /src/test/resources.
